// üêª Hi there! Here's an example of using the compound components API!
// They allow users of your component to ignore the implicit state that's
// shared between the compound components if they don't need access to
// it for rendering things.
//
// ü¶â It has the limitation that there's less flexibility over what gets
// rendered when used by itself because all state is implicitly shared.
// For example, if we wanted to render a different kind of button here,
// then we'd have to use one of the other patterns to access the
// `getTogglerProps` or the `toggle` function to attatch to the `onClick`
// handler of our custom button.
const CompoundComponents = (props) => (
  <Toggle {...props}>
    <Toggle.On>The button is on</Toggle.On>
    <Toggle.Off>The button is off</Toggle.Off>
    <Toggle.Button />
  </Toggle>
);

// ü¶Å Hey! Here's an example of using the render props API!!
// This gives the consumer 100% power over the rendering of the component.
// You can think of the render props API as simply moving the `render` method
// from your component to the consumer and accepting it as a prop.
//
// ü¶â One of the problems that this pattern suffers from is its susceptibility
// to the prop drilling problem (if you need to render a lot of UI and/or
// want to pass the state down through a few layers of components).
//
// Another problem this pattern suffers from is when composing multiple render props
// together you can wind up with a fairly deeply nested render method which
// can be pretty frustrating. You might consider using react-adopt if this
// is a problem for you.
//
// Finally, a third (sorta) problem with this approach is if you want access to
// lifecycle methods, you have to create a new component (for the lifecycle methods)
// and render that component: <Toggle>{props => <OtherComp {...props} />}</Toggle>
const RenderProps = (props) => {
  return (
    <Toggle {...props}>
      {({ on, getTogglerProps }) => (
        <div>
          {on ? "The button is on" : "The button is off"}
          <Switch {...getTogglerProps()} />
        </div>
      )}
    </Toggle>
  );
}

// ü¶Ü Hey! So here's the component injection pattern!
// It's almost identical to the render prop pattern except instead of simply
// calling the function you provide, it actually uses React.createElement.
// This means that you can use this pattern the same way you do render
// props if you want to, but you can also create a component and pass that
// instead and all your lifecycle methods will work as you'd expect.
//
// ü¶â This pattern suffers from the prop drilling problem that render props
// has.
//
// One other potential frustration with this pattern is if you don't
// need lifecycle hooks and you really only need a render method, the
// fact that it's calling React.createElement is wasteful and clutters
// up React DevTools.
const MyToggleConsumerComponent = ({ on, getTogglerProps }) => (
  <div>
    {on ? "The button is on" : "The button is off"}
    <Switch {...getTogglerProps()} />
  </div>
);

const ComponentInjection = (props) => {
  return <Toggle {...props}>{MyToggleConsumerComponent}</Toggle>;
}

// ü¶ä Hi there! Here's the provider pattern!
// This helps you overcome the prop drilling problem that the render prop
// and component injection patterns both have. It allows developers to
// get access to your component's state at any spot within the render tree
// of your component. It leverages React.createContext heavily and in this
// example it's a fairly straightforward abstraction on top of that API.
//
// ü¶â One thing you need to consider with this pattern is ensuring you're
// not re-rendering all consumers unecessarily. This is addressed and noted
// in our implementation above.
// Also, in our implementation, we're not exposing the ToggleContext directly
// and that's intentional. It allows us to implement the provider ourselves
// and expose a slightly more capable consumer. See the implementation notes
// for more on this.
const ProviderPattern = (props) => {
  return (
    <Toggle {...props}>
      <div>
        {/*
           You can put whatever you want within the Toggle, and at any layer of
           the tree use Toggle.Consumer to access the Toggle state and helpers
        */}
        <div>
          <Toggle.Consumer>
            {({ on, toggle, getTogglerProps }) => (
              <div>
                {on ? "The button is on" : "The button is off"}
                <Switch {...getTogglerProps()} />
              </div>
            )}
          </Toggle.Consumer>
        </div>
      </div>
    </Toggle>
  );
}

// üê∏ Hi! Here's our HOC example
// Here, you create a component that accepts the toggle state as a prop
// (called `toggle` here). Then you pass that component to the `withToggle`
// Higher Order Component function. That will return you a new component
// that will render yours with the toggle state.
const MyToggleComponent = ({ toggle: { on, getTogglerProps } }) => {
  return (
